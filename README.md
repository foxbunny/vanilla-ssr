# Vanilla SSR example (NodeJS)

This repository contains the example of a completely self-contained vanilla SSR 
implementation using NodeJS. This is production-ready code and it can be used 
as the starting point for your SSR-enabled projects.

## Running the example

The example can be executed using most recent versions of NodeJS, but was 
specifically tested using version 18 LTS.

To run the example, use the `node server.js` command.

## Environment variables

The `PORT` and `HOST` environment variables can be used to specify the port 
and host address respectively. The defaults are `8080` and `127.0.0.1` 
(localhost).

## Static files

The SSR server in this example is completely self-contained and does not 
rely on additional services such as static file server or CDN to serve the 
static files. The static files are found in the `public` directory, and are 
cached completely in-memory when the server starts.

## Dynamic HTML

The HTML generated by this server is dynamic, meaning it has data embedded 
inside of the markup that changes on each request. To simplify things, this data
is a simple timestamp. In real-world applications, the data might come from some
API or a database.

## Progressive enhancement

This simple application uses 
[progressive enhancement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement). 
This means that the basic features of the page will work without any 
client-side JavaScript or even without CSS. The client-side code, when 
available, will enhance the user experience, but it is never used for essential 
functionality.
